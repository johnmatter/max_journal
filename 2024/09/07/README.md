This code is inspired by [Coupled Map Lattices as Musical Instruments](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26777122)[^1]

The Max patch isn't yet stable, but I'm working toward using the [py-js external](https://github.com/shakfu/py-js) to use this python script in [Max/MSP patches](https://cycling74.com/products/max).
